# TicTacToe
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe developed using C language
This game consists of two modes, one for playing against computer and another for playing against another person.
The user (in case of player vs computer) or player one (in case of player vs player) is to play first and mark 'X' on the board.
The computer or player two is to mark 'O' on the board.
The player specifies the row and column number of a 3X3 matrix to specify the square he wants to mark.
The computer chooses its square based on four criteria:
i. If it has a chance of winning either in a row, column or one of two diagonals.
ii. If the player has a chance of winning either in a row, column or one of two diagonals.
iii. If the computer already has placed a mark in any of the row, column or one of two diagonal.
iv. In an empty square.
The order of choosing a square is as per the criteria mentioned above.
