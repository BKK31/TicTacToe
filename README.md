# TicTacToe
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe developed using C language<br>
This game consists of two modes, one for playing against computer and another for playing against another person.<br>
The user (in case of player vs computer) or player one (in case of player vs player) is to play first and mark 'X' on the board.<br>
The computer or player two is to mark 'O' on the board.<br>
The player specifies the row and column number of a 3X3 matrix to specify the square he wants to mark.<br>
The computer chooses its square based on four criteria:<br>
i. If it has a chance of winning either in a row, column or one of two diagonals.<br>
ii. If the player has a chance of winning either in a row, column or one of two diagonals.<br>
iii. If the computer already has placed a mark in any of the row, column or one of two diagonal.<br>
iv. In an empty square.<br>
The order of choosing a square is as per the criteria mentioned above.
